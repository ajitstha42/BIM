As the date for the US Presidential election draws near, interesting reports have started to emerge from the western power. Aside from the regular ‘assassination attempts’ and bizarre comments from those running in the race for the US polls, the divide over supporting Kamala Harris or Donald Trump grows wider with each day.
In a similar incident, while billionaire Elon Musk has thrown his support behind Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, many employees at Musk’s companies are predominantly backing Trump’s Democratic competitor, Kamala Harris.

According to data from OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit group that monitors US political donations, Tesla employees have contributed $42,824 to Harris’ campaign, compared to $24,840 for Trump. At SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, workers have donated $34,526 to Harris and $7,652 to Trump. Meanwhile, X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, has seen its employees contribute $13,213 to Harris, with less than $500 going to Trump.
 
The OpenSecrets data reflects donations from company staff, owners, and their immediate family members, as US campaign finance laws prevent companies from making direct contributions to federal elections.
Reuters cited Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a Tesla shareholder, as saying that many of Musk’s employees are based in California, a traditionally Democratic state. Gerber is also an investor in X.
Employee donations reflect political divide
While these contributions are relatively modest in the context of overall fundraising, they suggest a political stance among Musk’s employees that contrasts with Musk's own leanings. The billionaire has supported Trump on X and frequently criticised progressive viewpoints, which he refers to as the “woke-mind virus”.
Though he supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Musk has increasingly shifted his views to the right. Trump has stated that if he wins the upcoming election, he would appoint Musk to lead a government efficiency task force.

In July, Musk expressed plans to relocate the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas, citing a California law on gender identity as a tipping point. Gerber remarked that such a decision could result in ‘losing significant talent’ in California.
Musk’s controversial claims on Kamala harris
Earlier this week, Musk deleted a post on X in which he claimed that there were no assassination attempts on President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, despite a reported attempt on Trump’s life while he was playing golf. Musk, who bought X for $44 billion in 2022 and now has nearly 200 million followers on the platform, has become more aligned with conservative views in recent years and endorsed Trump for president.
While Musk has previously taken down controversial posts, he has also left up or doubled down on some inflammatory remarks. Last week, for instance, he made a joking comment about impregnating Taylor Swift after the singer endorsed Harris.
On Monday morning, following the removal of his post about the Trump assassination attempt, Musk tweeted, “Well, one lesson I’ve learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn’t mean it’s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.”

Surging small-scale renewables generation is helping China address growing power demand and slashing the role of coal in the country's power mix, but Beijing's widely followed monthly data reports omit output from the fast-growing sector.
 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which publishes monthly bulletins on key economic indicators, only surveys industrial firms with at least 20 million yuan ($2.84 million) of annual revenue from their main operations.

For the renewables sector, that has resulted in the NBS leaving out a significant chunk of generation from small-scale sources powering residences, offices and industries, making it more difficult to gain insights into China's economy.
 
 
The data is also masking some of the progress by the world's top greenhouse gas emitter in reducing the share of coal in electricity generation.
 
"Well-structured monthly reporting on energy and electricity data will be key for China to track progress against its carbon goals," said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
 
The NBS data shows China's power generation grew 6.4 per cent in the first half of 2024. However, data from London-based energy think tank Ember, which calculates output from small-scale renewable energy using data from China's National Energy Administration, shows electricity output grew 7.3 per cent.
 
The NBS provides monthly updates and has archives with uniform reporting patterns starting in the late 1980s. But NEA, China's energy regulator, does not provide a public schedule before disclosing data. It also stopped reporting information on utilisation rates in June, making periodically tracking generation from renewables difficult.

NEA did not respond to requests seeking comment and the NBS declined to comment beyond noting it surveys firms of a "designated size".
 
When analysts and investors "are looking at the total generation number and it is grossly underreported, especially the growth, then they are getting a skewed picture of what is happening in the economy," Myllyvirta said.
 
The discrepancy is mainly due to growth in additions of distributed solar over the last three years in China, with smaller installations growing at nearly twice the rate of large utility-scale solar farms - the main driver of renewable capacity additions in China in the previous decade.
 
Distributed solar, which includes rooftop panels, describes small installations suplying power near where it will be used.
Ember data shows the share of wind and solar in China's power output to be 20.3 per cent during the first half of 2024, much higher than the NBS figure of 15 per cent.
 
NBS places the share of fossil fuels in the country's power generation at 67.8 per cent, compared with Ember's estimate of 62.3 per cent based on NEA data.
 
"China NBS's generation data for wind and especially solar only capture some of the generation, whereas their capacity figures show the full picture," said Xuyang Dong, China energy policy analyst at Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance.
